# Today Was My Last Day At My Job!

Today (February 27th, 2025) was the day I was terminated from my employer. I was a lighting specialist for a major Canadian electrical wholesaler. I had sales that exceeded expectations, handled some of the biggest clients in Manitoba, and even tackled plenty of custom work for clients. In the end, my job was not secure.

# Today Is The Day I Begin My Freelance Journey.

Also today is the day I begin my freelance web development journey. I mention this briefly that I am a self-taught developer. I graduated from university with a Bachelor of Commerce and knew nothing of development.

I have always been a big fan of the tech scene and have always followed it. Until one day, I took a course on [Skillshare](https://www.skillshare.com/en/) directed by [Dan with Bring Your Own Laptop](https://bringyourownlaptop.com/join?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=brand2024&utm_term=bring%20your%20own%20laptop&utm_content=718216599257&gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAADjev9J1-EHLYf9JDd9c4ayLCngRX&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI8o6N8_HkiwMV9jQIBR02hTN2EAAYASAAEgLGe_D_BwE) for basic HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I fell for programming right after, well not for Bootstrap but HTML and vanilla CSS. I looked at how I could learn and if it was worth it to learn programming.

I came across [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) and [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) completing The Odin Project, freeCodeCamp I cannot get past the web-based text editor for coding for I have not completed everything on there. The Odin Project has allowed me to be able to understand programming languages through just the documentation.

Since completing this course a year ago, I have been working on my own personal and family projects that I feel comfortable beginning a freelancing option for web development. And I know, I hear you saying “Well, you haven’t worked on anything major like Netflix or Shopify or Amazon. What makes you qualified to do this?” And you are correct, I haven’t, which would ultimately make me more affordable than the average web developer. I don’t have an extensive background in the tech industry or a high ego.

## Where am I Going From Here?

Today marks the day I begin a new chapter in my life. Today is the day I begin canvasing possible clients for new websites, website redesign, and website management. When one door closes another one opens. Let’s go through the wall and make my own door.
