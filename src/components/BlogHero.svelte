    <h1 class="">Welcome to My Personal Blog!</h1>
    <p class="text-base">This blog will be me posting and talking about my journey into the world of development. I have been doing web development for 2 years now. I love it but I want to dive deeper into the thick of things. I have taught myself several different languages but they only revolve around web development. Now I want to shift into app and game development. So I thought I would talk about it, both as a reminder to myself and to help others who need some help or whom are interested. </p>
