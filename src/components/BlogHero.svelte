        Welcome to My Personal Blog!
    </h1>
    <p class="text-base text-center">
        This blog will be me posting and talking about my journey into the world of development. I have been doing web development for 2 years roughly. <br> I love it but I want to dive deeper into the thick of things. I have taught myself several different languages however, they only revolve around web development. Now I want to shift into app and game development. <br> So I thought I would talk about it, both as a reminder to myself and to help others who need some help or whom are interested.
